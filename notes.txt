I could not figure out why my maze solver was searching every cell in the maze until it reached the end of the maze. Originally
I thought that I had to get the neighbour at index 0, so I would never go out of bounds:
Line 65 was originally: Cell added = cells.push(cell.getNeighbours().get(0);
I thought to myself if getting the first index searches all the cells then the opposite of the first index (last index)
could give the opposite result. So I changed line 65 to:
Line 65 after: Cell added = cells.push(cell.getNeighbours().get(cell.getNeighbours().size()-1));
Suddenly my best path algorithm worked, and it searched the least amount of cells before reaching the end of the maze.


TO DO
To make the algorithm find the best path I will change the solver to choose the neighbour that
is closer to the end cell.

Increase size of maze in maze solver. Right now StackOverflowException occurs on bigger mazes, so I would have to handle
that probably by using multithreading

Handle exceptions more
